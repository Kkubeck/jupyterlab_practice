    " I think this cell fulfills what i think is the questions requirement to build a function that 'computes the mean of the values in a list and prints the results'.\n",
    " This is not the usual way i would code a function, which would typically involve returning the mean directly to a print function outside\n",
    " of the compute_mean() function. Here I used type hinting to make sure it was understood that the function returns None. \n",
    "\n",
    " #### Method\n",
    " Here we calculate the mean of a list of numbers by first taking the sum() of the list of numbers and then divide them by the number of elements in the list.\n",
